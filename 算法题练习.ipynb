      "+ Such behavior is due to CPython optimization (called string interning) that tries to use existing immutable objects in some cases rather than creating a new object every time.\n",
      "+ After being interned, many variables may point to the same string object in memory (thereby saving memory).\n",
      "+ In the snippets above, strings are implicitly interned. The decision of when to implicitly intern a string is implementation dependent. There are some facts that can be used to guess if a string will be interned or not:\n",
      "  * All length 0 and length 1 strings are interned.\n",
      "  * Strings are interned at compile time (`'wtf'` will be interned but `''.join(['w', 't', 'f']` will not be interned)\n",
      "  * Strings that are not composed of ASCII letters, digits or underscores, are not interned. This explains why `'wtf!'` was not interned due to `!`. Cpython implementation of this rule can be found [here](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Objects/codeobject.c#L19)\n",
      "  <img src=\"/images/string-intern/string_intern.png\" alt=\"\">\n",
      "+ When `a` and `b` are set to `\"wtf!\"` in the same line, the Python interpreter creates a new object, then references the second variable at the same time. If you do it on separate lines, it doesn't \"know\" that there's already `wtf!` as an object (because `\"wtf!\"` is not implicitly interned as per the facts mentioned above). It's a compiler optimization and specifically applies to the interactive environment.\n",
      "+ Constant folding is a technique for [peephole optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peephole_optimization) in Python. This means the expression `'a'*20` is replaced by `'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'` during compilation to reduce few clock cycles during runtime. Constant folding only occurs for strings having length less than 20. (Why? Imagine the size of `.pyc` file generated as a result of the expression `'a'*10**10`). [Here's](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Python/peephole.c#L288) the implementation source for the same.\n",

      "#### 💡 Explanation\n",
      "- You can read more about [timeit](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html) from here. It is generally used to measure the execution time of snippets.\n",
      "- Don't use `+` for generating long strings — In Python, `str` is immutable, so the left and right strings have to be copied into the new string for every pair of concatenations. If you concatenate four strings of length 10, you'll be copying (10+10) + ((10+10)+10) + (((10+10)+10)+10) = 90 characters instead of just 40 characters. Things get quadratically worse as the number and size of the string increases (justified with the execution times of `add_bytes_with_plus` function)\n",
      "- Therefore, it's advised to use `.format.` or `%` syntax (however, they are slightly slower than `+` for short strings).\n",
      "- Or better, if already you've contents available in the form of an iterable object, then use `''.join(iterable_object)` which is much faster.\n",
      "- `add_string_with_plus` didn't show a quadratic increase in execution time unlike `add_bytes_with_plus` because of the `+=` optimizations discussed in the previous example. Had the statement been `s = s + \"x\" + \"y\" + \"z\"` instead of `s += \"xyz\"`, the increase would have been quadratic.\n",

      "\n",
      "  **💡 Explanation:**\n",
      "  If `join()` is a method on a string then it can operate on any iterable (list, tuple, iterators). If it were a method on a list, it'd have to be implemented separately by every type. Also, it doesn't make much sense to put a string-specific method on a generic `list` object API.\n",

      "  + There is no `++` operator in Python grammar. It is actually two `+` operators.\n",
